# data_analysis_for_bus_stops_Brazil - This project intends to study and describe the routes and stops for bus lines for a specified city in Brazil.

This project Pulls public data from public bus transportation in a specific city.

This project is data exploration from data gathered by applications and gathered by the mayor's house.


If you want to run the project and have fun with me, ask me for the stop_times.txt file, since this is a pretty big one and I couldn't upload it to the repository.
